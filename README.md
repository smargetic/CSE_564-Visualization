Course Description:
Discusses both foundations and applications of this emerging paradigm known as visual analytics. It begins with the basics- visual perception, cognition, human-computer interaction, the sense-making process, data mining, computer graphics, and information visualization.

This class was taken Spring 2020 semester. This was the first time I had ever delt with web development. I started the course asking what language to write the projects in, without knowing that an html file, css file, and javascript file were needed.
